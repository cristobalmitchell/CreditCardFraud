# Credit Card Fraud Detection
We will explore various models utilizing a credit card transaction data set from Kaggle and evaluating which has the best performance metrics for classifying an incoming transaction as fraudulent or normal. The data set is provided by The Machine Learning Group (MLG) of Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and contains transactions made by european cardholders in September 2013.

The jupyter notebook walks readers through the end to end process of building machine learning models from exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and variable relationship analysis to model creation and validation.
